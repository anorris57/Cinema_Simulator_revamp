# Cinema_Simulator_revamp
Variation of Cinema Simulator for Python Bible course.  Showing use of dictionaries, strings, list, if statements, taking user input and updating variables. 

I added additional logic of 
  * showing list of films to user
  * updating information to user if film not availble (reminder * to check list or spelling)
  * allowing user to ask for more than one ticket
  * comparison logic it number of tickets asked for is greater than number of tickets remaining
  * feed back to let user know that numbers of tickets requested is greater then number availbe and show the number of remaining tickets

Ways to build upon or improve: 
  *Give each title a number so that all users need to do is input a number to idenify the movie instead of being concerned with spelling or case of answer.
